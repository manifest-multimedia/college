## Introduction

The Exam Clearance System ensures that only eligible students can access examinations by verifying that they have met all academic and financial requirements. This module integrates with the Finance Module and Academic Module to automate the clearance process, reducing administrative overhead while maintaining compliance with institutional policies.

Exam clearance serves as a critical checkpoint to enforce college policies regarding fee payment, attendance requirements, and other institutional obligations before students sit for examinations.
