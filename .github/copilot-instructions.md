🛠️ Laravel Development Standards — Refined Instructions
📦 Framework & Tools
Laravel Version: 12.11.1

Livewire: Uses tag-based syntax — e.g., <livewire:component-name />

🖼️ View Layout Standards
Use Laravel Blade Components for all views:

✅ Layouts
Backend Views: Use components.backend.layout.blade.php

Dashboard Views: Use components.default.layout.blade.php

📌 Note: Use components.dashboard.default for all dashboard-related views.

✅ UI Guidelines
Use Bootstrap for frontend styling.

For card headers, wrap content using the card-title class for consistency:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="card-header">
    <div class="something-else">
        <h1 class="card-title">
            <i>some icon</i>
        </h1>
    </div>
</div>
🗃️ Database Migration Policy
✅ Allowed
You may modify migration files only for new features under development and not deployed to production.

Use php artisan migrate:rollback (not migrate:fresh) during active development to fix migration-related issues.

❌ Not Allowed
Never alter migration files for features already in production.

📌 For Existing Deployed Features
If you need to update the schema for production features (e.g., add/modify columns):

Create a new migration file.

This maintains backward compatibility and production stability.

⚠️ Migration Cautions
Before creating a new migration:

Ensure no existing migration causes conflicts.

When building relationships:

Be mindful of how ID fields are defined (increments('id') vs id()).

Always confirm ID type compatibility between related tables.

🔧 New Feature Development Instructions (Finance & Exam Clearance Modules)
New feature development is documented in exam-prd.md.

Layouts: Use components.dashboard.default for all related views.

Migrations can still be revised until final production deployment.

🧩 Navigation Updates
When features are complete, update the sidebar navigation:

File: components.app.sidebar
