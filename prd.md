| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR001          | Create Election          | As an admin, I want to create new elections so that students can vote.                          | Admin users can define an election name, description, and set a start and end time (deadline).                      |
| FR002          | Define Roles/Positions   | As an admin, I want to define various positions (e.g., President, Secretary) for each election. | Admin can assign roles to an election and manage roles separately.                                                  |
| FR003          | Add Candidates to Roles  | As an admin, I want to add candidates for each position in the election.                        | Candidates can be assigned to roles/positions along with their bios, images, and optional manifesto documents.      |
| FR004          | Use Election Template    | As an admin, I want to create a new election using the roles/positions from a previous one.     | Admin can select an existing election template, clone the structure (roles), and then assign new candidates.        |
| FR005          | Set Voting Deadline      | As an admin, I want to set the voting period so students know the time window to vote.          | Elections must have start and end dates. Voting is only allowed within this period.                                 |
| FR006          | Student Verification     | As a student, I want to verify myself before voting using my Student ID.                        | The system validates Student ID before granting access to vote. Duplicate voting is prevented.                      |
| FR007          | Start Voting Session     | As a student, I want to begin my voting session and have limited time to complete it.           | Once verified, a session timer starts. When it expires, the student can no longer vote.                             |
| FR008          | Vote for Candidates      | As a student, I want to see all roles and candidates so I can vote for my preferred ones.       | A modern UI displays all positions and associated candidates. The student can vote once per position.               |
| FR009          | Submit Votes             | As a student, I want to submit my votes when Iâ€™m done and be logged out.                        | Votes are submitted in one action. The voter is logged out and can't re-enter even if their session is still valid. |
| FR010          | Prevent Duplicate Voting | As a system, I want to prevent voters from voting more than once.                               | Once a vote is submitted, the Student ID is marked as used and cannot be used again.                                |
| FR011          | Voting Session Expiry    | As a system, I want to auto-expire voting sessions after a certain time.                        | If the voter doesn't submit within the session window, they are locked out from voting.                             |
| FR012          | Real-time Vote Counting  | As an admin, I want to see vote counts in real time so I can track election progress.           | Admins can view real-time results with charts/visualizations for each position.                                     |
| FR013          | Election Results Display | As a user, I want to see the final results and winners after the election ends.                 | After the deadline, results and winners for each position are available in a view-only format.                      |
| FR014          | Export Results           | As an admin, I want to export results in Excel or PDF for offline storage or reporting.         | Admins can export full voting data and summary results.                                                             |
