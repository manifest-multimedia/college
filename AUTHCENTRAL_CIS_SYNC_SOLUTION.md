# AuthCentral & CIS Password Synchronization Solution

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive solution implemented to address authentication issues between AuthCentral and the College Information System (CIS). The solution enables seamless password synchronization and flexible authentication options.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. AuthCentral SSO Error in Regular Mode
**Issue**: Users received "AuthCentral authentication is not enabled" error when trying to use SSO in regular mode.
**Solution**: Removed authentication method restrictions to allow SSO regardless of AUTH_METHOD setting.

### 2. Security-Conscious Error Messages
**Issue**: Error messages revealed too much information to potential attackers.
**Solution**: Implemented generic authentication failure messages that don't reveal user existence or suggest attack vectors.

### 3. Password Synchronization Gap
**Issue**: Users created via AuthCentral couldn't login with their AuthCentral password directly to CIS.
**Root Cause**: AuthCentral API doesn't return plain text passwords (security best practice), so CIS was setting random passwords.
**Solution**: Implemented bidirectional webhook-based password synchronization.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. CIS Side Changes

#### AuthController.php
- Removed authentication method check in `handleCallback()`
- Enhanced logging for better monitoring
- Added support for password sync from AuthCentral API responses

#### AuthenticationService.php
- Updated `getAuthCentralLoginUrl()` to work in all modes
- Enhanced `createOrUpdateAuthCentralUser()` with better password handling
- Added `getPasswordSyncConfig()` method
- Improved password preservation logic

#### PasswordSyncController.php
- Enhanced webhook endpoint with comprehensive validation
- Added support for different password sync events
- Implemented secure API key verification using `hash_equals()`
- Added detailed logging for security auditing

#### RegularAuthController.php
- Improved error messaging for failed authentication
- Removed restrictions on AuthCentral users using email/password login
- Added helpful guidance in error messages

#### Configuration Updates
- Added `password_sync` section to `config/authentication.php`
- Removed security restrictions that prevented flexible authentication
- Updated `.env.example` with new password sync variables

### 2. AuthCentral Side Changes

#### User.php Model
- Added automatic password synchronization via model events
- Implemented `setPasswordAttribute()` to capture plain text passwords before hashing
- Added `boot()` method with event listeners for created/updated events
- Ensured password sync happens on user registration and password changes

#### PasswordSyncWebhookController.php
- Created webhook client to call CIS password sync API
- Added error handling and comprehensive logging
- Implemented static helper method for easy integration
- Added timeout and retry logic

#### StudentRegistrationController.php & UserController.php
- Updated to let model handle password hashing and sync
- Removed manual `Hash::make()` calls to enable sync
- Added logging for registration events

#### Environment Configuration
- Added CIS connection settings to `.env.example`
- Configured webhook URL and API key settings

## Configuration Guide

### CIS Application (.env)

```bash
# Password Synchronization
PASSWORD_SYNC_ENABLED=true
PASSWORD_SYNC_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here
PASSWORD_SYNC_WEBHOOK_URL=/api/auth-sync/password

# Flexible Authentication (both methods always available)
AUTH_METHOD=regular  # or authcentral
```

### AuthCentral Application (.env)

```bash
# CIS Integration
CIS_PASSWORD_SYNC_URL=https://college.pnmtc.edu.gh/api/auth-sync/password
CIS_PASSWORD_SYNC_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here
```

**Important**: Use the same `API_KEY` value in both applications for security.

## Security Features

1. **API Key Authentication**: All webhook requests require matching API keys
2. **Hash-Based Comparison**: Uses `hash_equals()` to prevent timing attacks
3. **Request Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all webhook parameters
4. **Audit Logging**: Detailed logs for all authentication and sync events
5. **Generic Error Messages**: No information leakage to potential attackers
6. **Timeout Protection**: HTTP requests have reasonable timeouts
7. **Event-Based Sync**: Only syncs on actual password changes

## User Experience Improvements

### Flexible Login Options
- Users can now choose between SSO and direct email/password login
- Both options are always visible on the login page
- Clear visual separation with "OR" divider
- Helpful guidance in error messages

### Automatic Password Sync
- New AuthCentral registrations automatically sync passwords to CIS
- Password changes in AuthCentral immediately sync to CIS
- Users can seamlessly switch between authentication methods

## API Endpoints

### CIS Password Sync Webhook
```
POST /api/auth-sync/password
Headers: X-API-Key: your-api-key
Body: {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "plaintext-password",
    "event": "password_changed|user_registered|password_reset",
    "api_key": "your-api-key"
}
```

### Health Check
```
GET /api/auth-sync/health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Password Sync Not Working
1. Check API keys match in both applications
2. Verify webhook URL is accessible from AuthCentral
3. Check application logs for sync failures
4. Ensure firewall allows HTTP requests between applications

### Authentication Errors
1. Check user exists in both systems
2. Verify password was properly synced (check logs)
3. Test both SSO and direct login methods
4. Clear browser cache and cookies

### User Can't Login After AuthCentral Registration
1. Check CIS logs for webhook receive confirmation
2. Verify user record exists in CIS database
3. Test password reset flow as fallback
4. Confirm API keys are configured correctly

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Log Monitoring
Monitor these log patterns:
- `Password synchronized successfully`
- `Failed to sync password`
- `Unauthorized password sync attempt`
- `AuthCentral authentication successful`

### Regular Checks
1. Verify webhook endpoint availability
2. Test password sync with new registrations
3. Monitor authentication success rates
4. Review security logs for suspicious activity

## Deployment Checklist

### CIS Application
- [ ] Update configuration files
- [ ] Set `PASSWORD_SYNC_API_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Clear config cache: `php artisan config:clear`
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint accessibility

### AuthCentral Application
- [ ] Set `CIS_PASSWORD_SYNC_URL` and `CIS_PASSWORD_SYNC_API_KEY`
- [ ] Test outbound HTTP connectivity to CIS
- [ ] Clear config cache if needed
- [ ] Verify model events are working

### Both Applications
- [ ] API keys match exactly
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for production
- [ ] Firewall rules allow communication
- [ ] Log monitoring is active

## Success Metrics

After implementation, you should see:
1. ✅ **Zero "AuthCentral authentication is not enabled" errors**
2. ✅ **Users can login with either SSO or email/password**
3. ✅ **New AuthCentral users can immediately use direct login**
4. ✅ **Password changes in AuthCentral work in CIS within minutes**
5. ✅ **Improved security with generic error messages**
6. ✅ **Comprehensive audit logs for all authentication events**

## Conclusion

This solution provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication system that:
- Maintains security best practices
- Provides flexible user authentication options
- Enables seamless password synchronization
- Includes comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Improves overall user experience
