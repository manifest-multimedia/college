| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR001          | Fee Billing          | As a finance officer, I want to bill students per semester for different fee types so that payment obligations are clearly defined. | Admin can create fee types (school fees, departmental fees, etc.) and assign them per student/semester.         |
| FR002          | Record Payments      | As a cashier/finance officer, I want to record fee payments from students.                                                          | Payment entries can be made per student against billed amounts. Partial payments are allowed.                   |
| FR003          | Master Fee List      | As a finance officer, I want to generate a list of students with pending and completed payments.                                    | The system shows a list of paid/unpaid students, sortable and exportable.                                       |
| FR004          | Course Registration  | As a student, I want to register for courses each semester if I‚Äôve paid at least 60% of my fees.                                    | If payment >= 60%, allow course registration. If not, show a "See Finance Department" message.                  |
| FR005          | Exam Registration    | As a student, I want to register for exams if I‚Äôve completed 100% payment.                                                          | For end-of-semester exams, payment must be 100%. Mid-semester exams do not require full payment.                |
| FR006          | Manual Clearance     | As a finance manager, I want to manually clear a student for exams under special cases.                                             | Admin override allows manual clearance despite unpaid fees.                                                     |
| FR007          | Clearance List       | As an admin, I want a master list of students cleared for mid-semester and end-of-semester exams.                                   | System generates clearance lists per exam type (midterm or final) based on payment and manual overrides.        |
| FR008          | QR Code Generation   | As a system, I want to generate QR codes for cleared students to use for exam check-in.                                             | After clearance, each student receives a QR ticket containing verification metadata.                            |
| FR009          | QR Scan Verification | As an examiner, I want to scan a QR code and see if a student is cleared for the exam.                                              | Scanning reveals Student ID, Name, Photo, and either ‚ÄúCleared for Exam‚Äù or ‚ÄúDisqualified for Exam.‚Äù             |
| FR010          | Exam Mode Support    | As a system, I want to distinguish between online and offline exams.                                                                | QR verification is only triggered for offline exams.                                                            |
| FR011          | QR API Endpoint      | As a developer, I want an API endpoint that returns verification details for QR codes.                                              | Endpoint returns JSON with student status, name, ID, photo, and clearance status.                               |
| FR012          | Scanner Interface    | As a developer/exam officer, I want a custom scanner interface using the API endpoint.                                              | Browser-based or mobile interface for scanning QR codes using webcam or phone camera, showing real-time status. |
